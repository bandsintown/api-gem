    #This is used to cancel an event on Bandsintown for a single artist.  If you want to cancel the entire event (all artists), use Bandsintown::Event#cancel.
    #If successful, this method will always return a status message.
    #Unless you have a trusted app_id, events added or removed through the API will need to be approved before the changes are seen live.
    #Contact Bandsintown if you are often adding events and would like a trusted account.
    #See http://www.bandsintown.com/api/requests#artists-cancel-event for more information.

    #====examples:
    #Cancel an artist's event with a non-trusted app_id:
    #   artist = Bandsintown::Artist.new(:name => "Little Brother")
    #   event_id = 12345
    #   artist.cancel_event(event_id)

    #Cancel an artist's event with a trusted app_id:
    #   artist = Bandsintown::Artist.new(:name => "Little Brother")
    #   event_id = 12345
    #   artist.cancel_event(event_id)
